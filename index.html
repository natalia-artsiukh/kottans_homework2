                    Any talk of horror history somehow inevitably turns to Howard Phillips Lovecraft, the failed      writer who, after his death, suddenly found greatness that he could not even imagine in his lifetime.Only then did readers (and other writers) suddenly realize what a fundamental invention the pale guy from Providence had introduced into culture. He was not the first to guess that the worst thing is the misunderstood and inaccessible to understanding, devoid of our logic. But it was in his hands that this rule received its clearest confirmation.
